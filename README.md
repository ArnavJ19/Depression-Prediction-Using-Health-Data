# Depression-Prediction-Using-Health-Data
The project involves analyzing the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) 2020 dataset to predict whether individuals have a depressive disorder. The dataset contains over 5000 records with a mix of categorical and numerical features, capturing health behaviors, conditions, and demographics of U.S. adults.

The project begins with a thorough data preprocessing phase, which includes cleaning the dataset by removing irrelevant, redundant, and low-variance features. Missing values in both numerical and categorical attributes were handled using statistical techniques, such as mean or median for numerical values and mode for categorical ones. The dataset, initially imbalanced, was balanced using Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) and Both Sampling techniques to ensure that the model performs well across all classes.

After preprocessing, feature selection methods such as Information Gain, Stepwise Feature Selection, and Recursive Feature Elimination were applied to reduce the feature set to the most relevant attributes for the model. The project then focused on building multiple machine learning models, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM), Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), and k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN). Each model was tuned and evaluated for its performance using metrics such as precision, recall, F-measure, and ROC curves.

GBM emerged as the best-performing model, especially when using BOTH sampling techniques for data balancing and Stepwise Feature Selection. The project also met the extra credit criteria by achieving high accuracy in classification. The result is a highly optimized and effective model that predicts depressive disorders based on health data, with a focus on maximizing both predictive accuracy and model interpretability.
